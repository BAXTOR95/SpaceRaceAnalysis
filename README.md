# Space Missions Analysis

Welcome to the Space Missions Analysis repository! Here, you'll find an incredibly rich dataset from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com) that includes all the space missions since the beginning of the Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957! This dataset provides comprehensive information about mission status (success/failure), mission costs, the number of launches per country, and much more.

## Introduction

The Space Race began in 1957, marking a significant era of competition and collaboration in space exploration between the USA and the Soviet Union. This dataset captures the historical and ongoing trends in space missions, offering a unique opportunity to analyze and visualize key insights.

## Key Questions Explored

With this dataset, you can explore a multitude of questions, such as:

- **Who launched the most missions in any given year?**
- **How has the cost of a space mission varied over time?**
- **Which months are the most popular for launches?**
- **Have space missions gotten safer or has the chance of failure remained unchanged?**

## Analyses and Visualizations

In this repository, you'll find various analyses and visualizations that uncover fascinating insights from the dataset. Here are some highlights:
